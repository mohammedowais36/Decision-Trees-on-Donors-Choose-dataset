# Decision-Trees-on-Donors-Choose-dataset
A decision tree is a flowchart-like structure in which each internal node represents a "test" on an attribute, each branch represents the outcome of the test, and each leaf node represents a class label. This project involves in implementation of Naive Bayes, Decision Trees, GBDT algorithms on Donor choose dataset. The goal is to predict whether or not a DonorsChoose.org project proposal submitted by a teacher will be approved, using the text of project descriptions as well as additional metadata about the project, teacher, and school. DonorsChoose.org can then use this information to identify projects most likely to need further review before approval.
